# ShipGame
The 'Find the Shipwreck' game was developed as a miniature terminal-based game with the primary objective of showcasing our proficiency in project development for the Data Structures course undertaken during my second semester of sophomore year. The game served as a practical demonstration of my understanding of core concepts of Data Structures.
