# ShipGame

Find the Shipwreck is a terminal-based game project developed to exemplify adeptness in project development within the realm of Data Structures. Initially created during my sophomore year, this project stands as a testament to the evolution and growth of my skills and knowledge in software development. With an emphasis on employing fundamental data structures, particularly arrays and linked lists, the game offers an engaging simulation reminiscent of classic naval warfare strategy.

## Key Features

- **Utilization of Diverse Data Structures and OOP Implementation:** Through the integration of arrays and linked lists, Find the Shipwreck demonstrates a nuanced understanding and application of essential data structures and object-oriented programming.

- **Immersion in Naval Warfare Strategy:** Drawing inspiration from the popular game format of hunting down enemy ships, Find the Shipwreck provides players with a challenge to locate hidden shipwrecks within an 8 x 8 dimensional grid.

- **Reflection of Growth and Development:** Find the Shipwreck embodies the advancement in proficiency and sophistication attained over time. Each line of code reflects a deeper understanding of software development principles and techniques at the time, showcasing maturation in both skill set and approach to problem-solving.

In essence, Find the Shipwreck serves not only as a testament to past accomplishments but also as a harbinger of future potential. It underscores a commitment to continuous improvement, laying the foundation for further innovation and exploration in the dynamic field of software development.
